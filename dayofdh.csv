"In the summer of 2015, I went away, to GEEK CAMP - well, it really wasn't Geek Camp - it was ILiADS. I had the incredible opportunity to take the time and space to learn and grow with colleagues as we investigated the field of digital humanities. I had a seed of an idea as to how I wanted to find the intersection of digital humanities in my courses with digital humanities research. I felt this weeklong adventure would provide the challenges and supports I needed. At ILiADS, ideas grew through collaborative, iterative processes. During this week of digital immersion, my team of myself and Sharon Birch, built upon an established digital pedagogy project but eventually created something new! I am a much more engaged digital humanities learner and thinker because of this experience.",Divonna Stebick,Associate Professor of Education,2017
"For me this field is defined by two words: one is dynamism (Ray Siemens); the other is the concept of creation that I am borrowing from Stephen Ramsey's influential essay: ""On Building."" At the intersection of these two concepts, one can find, in my opinion, the heart of the Digital Humanities. For me Digital Humanities is the space in which the computer and the humanistic world intersect in a dynamic, changing and innovative way that always leads to the creation of something new.",Beatriz Trigo,Associate Professor of Spanish,2017
"Digital humanities offer a new platform for the Civil War Institute to fulfill its public mission to engage with broad audiences about Civil War history and memory while facilitating our educational mission to prepare our students for 21st century careers in history and related fields. Our blog, The Gettysburg Compiler, has received considerable attention in the last year, including from the editorial staff of Wordpress.com and Ta-Nahesi Coates of The Atlantic. This recognition has allowed our students' work to reach far beyond the corners of our campus here in Gettysburg, providing them with an audience to engage as they experiment with their writing and other forms of digital communications including videos and podcasts. Our newest digital humanities project will help connect virtual tourists with the stories of men who gave the last full measure of devotion here at the Battle of Gettysburg. As a recent graduate myself, I have always appreciated opportunities like these to work on assignments that will have a life beyond the grade they receive. And digital though they may be, these projects provide ample reasons to get out and participate in analog experiences like research trips and on-the-ground learning, which can in turn illuminate new ways of enhancing a given project. ","Kevin Lavery, '16",Interim Assistant Director of the Civil War Institute,2017
"For an environmental humanities scholar, the ""digital humanities is ..."" not only the humanities expressed online, but also an awareness of the digital sphere's grounding in the material environment. From production to post-consumption, the digital is possible because of software as well as hardware that includes nonhuman and human bodies being physically involved, whether in the work/play of everyday convenience, or in the work of natural resource extraction.",Salma Monani,Associate Professor of Environmental Studies,2017
"Working on The First World War Letters of H.J.C. Peirs (www.jackpeirs.org), has provided an amazing opportunity for a small number of students, faculty, and administrators to collaborate in unique ways. While each member of #teampeirs brought research and technology experience to the project, we have honed our skills together as we developed the project and now reach beyond the website. Digital Humanities or, more specifically, digital history is the medium that we are working in to do history, tell stories, and to explore larger issues and experiences. We are striving to create conversations as well as content. Work done by our students is reaching an international audience. We can dig deeply into material on the website, provide continual updates on Twitter, create levity on Facebook, and reach new audiences with Instagram. This diversity of communications tools results in a more immersive experience than could be achieved with one of them alone or with a traditional publication. For me, doing digital humanities has meant joining old skills with new ones and having a chance to do something that I love. It has meant the chance to join the scholarly conversation in a way that was not when I was in college or graduate school. Finally, it has given me opportunities to learn as I am teaching, which is always the best aspect of any job I have had.","Amy Lucadamo, '00",College Archivist,2017
"Digital Scholarship is divided into two disciplines. The first is the collection, organization, enhancing, and cataloging of digital data. The second is the representation of this digital data and researching using this digital data. The Map-Picture Overlay project my research students have been working on is an example of how these two areas can overlap. The software is being designed to take maps that are images (such as historic maps or atlas maps) and place them on GIS systems, like Open Street Maps, Bing maps, or even Google maps. Once this is completed, these maps with their lat-long information will be placed in a database, and these maps will be available to any application that wants to place historic maps on a background by lat-long. This would be helpful for comparing historic maps to accurate GIS maps, or comparing historic maps to each other. This information could also be used to enhance other applications which have markers that have lat-long data associated with them, but would like to display the information from those markers on more historic or symbolic maps.",Chuck Kann,Adjunct Professor of Computer Science,2017
"Digital humanities is the scholarship I did over the summer, the field that allows me to conduct individualized research, the place where my voice is heard, the discipline where the digital collides with the humanities, and a place I call home.","Keira Koch, '19",Interdisciplinary Studies Major,2017
"Digital Humanities is getting an idea, soliciting support, building something, scrapping it, borrowing code/tools from somewhere else, pulling it all together, and showing it to the world. Much like this Day of DH 2017 website. But seriously, for me, it means getting to work with students and colleagues to do creative scholarship in new, collaborative, and open ways.",R.C. Miessler,Systems Librarian,2017
"In the context of my work with undergraduates in the library, DH means using digital tools to ask or answer questions in the humanities. Using digital platforms to communicate the results of academic research is an exciting, engaging alternative to the traditional paper. Also, I appreciate and value the DH commitment to open scholarship. It almost always benefits authors to share their work openly; it certainly benefits the world's learners.",Janelle Wertzberger,Assistant Dean of the Library and Director of Scholarly Communications,2017
"The digital humanities support teaching and research by bringing places, people, art, and texts alive in a multi-dimensional way and into new views and new arrangements that can prompt us to think about them differently. And it's just fun.",Megan Sijapati,Associate Professor of Religious Studies,2017
